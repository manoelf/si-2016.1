Editing archive to show conflicts!!

t really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its
branching model.

Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be
entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of
those lines of development takes seconds.

This means that you can do things like:

Frictionless Context Switching. Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a
few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back
to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.


Role-Based Codelines. Have a branch that always contains only what goes to
production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller
ones for day to day work.
